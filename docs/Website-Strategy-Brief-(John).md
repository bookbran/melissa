# **Website Strategy Brief: [Melissa Cikara](mailto:melissacikara@gmail.com)**

**Prepared for:** John (PM) and James (Dev)  
**Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Client:** Melissa — Big Joy Company  
**Document Type:** Website Requirements & Strategy

## Executive Summary

Melissa is launching **Melissa Cikara**, a strategic partnership service for established entrepreneurs who want to grow but feel buried in everything they have to do. This is NOT a VA service. This is a high-level, executive-experienced partner who helps clients get clear on priorities AND stays in the work to ensure execution.

The website is a **simple brochure site** with one primary goal: **get qualified prospects to book a discovery call**.

## Brand Positioning

### The One-Line Pitch

*"I don't just help you get clear — I stay in it with you and make sure it actually gets done."*

### The Full Positioning Statement

*"I help established entrepreneurs separate what's actually moving their business forward from everything else competing for their attention. Then I either do the other stuff, systematize it, or get it off your plate entirely — so you can execute on what matters without the rest falling through the cracks. I'm not just a coach — I ask the questions AND stay in the work with you. I'm a strategic partner with 20 years of operations experience who sees the whole picture and works alongside you to make sure the right things get done."*

### Core Emotional Response

When someone lands on this site, they should think:

**"Oh shit, she *gets* me — I need this."**

## Target Audience

### Ideal Client Profile

| Attribute | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Stage** | Established entrepreneur — NOT brand new. Already earning income, has clients. |
| **Situation** | Wants to GROW — add speaking, launch a membership, expand offerings. Feels buried in everything. |
| **Mindset** | Passionate, decisive, has "heart." Knows they need help but doesn't want just a task-doer. |
| **Pain Points** | Overwhelmed by trying to do everything. Productive procrastination. Can't focus on zone of genius. |
| **Desire** | Relief. A big sigh. Someone in their corner who gets the big picture and helps make it real. |

### Who This Is NOT For

- Brand new entrepreneurs still figuring out their offer  
- People looking for a cheap VA to do task lists  
- Financial advisors (unless they're passionate solo entrepreneurs)  
- People who aren't decisive or are still in "spaghetti at the wall" mode

---

## What Makes Melissa Different

| Other Offerings | Melissa |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Coaches** ask questions, help you think — then you're on your own to execute | Melissa asks the questions AND stays in the work with you |
| **Consultants** give advice and leave | Melissa stays alongside you to make sure it gets done |
| **VAs** wait for task lists | Melissa helps BUILD the priorities, then handles them |
| **Generic "support"** | Melissa has 20 years of C-suite experience, sees the whole picture, and helps you shift how you work to fit who you are |
