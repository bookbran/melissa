## Key Tools & Templates

### 1. Outreach Message Template

**For Warm Contacts:**

> Subject: Quick question + coffee chat?
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> I hope you're doing well! I'm working on something new and immediately thought of you.
>
> I'm launching a strategic partnership service for established entrepreneurs — helping them get clear on what's actually moving their business forward and making sure it gets done (instead of drowning in everything else).
>
> I'm having a few conversations with people I respect to test my thinking and make sure I'm on the right track. Would you be open to a 20-30 minute chat sometime in the next week or two? No pitch, I promise — I'd genuinely love your perspective.
>
> Either way, hope you're thriving!
>
> Melissa

**For Slightly Cooler Contacts:**

> Subject: Reconnecting + a quick favor
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> It's been a while! I hope things are going well with [something specific if you know it].
>
> I'm reaching out because I'm launching something new and doing some informal research. I'm building a strategic partnership service for established entrepreneurs — helping them focus on what matters and actually get it done.
>
> I'm having conversations with entrepreneurs I admire to make sure my thinking is solid. Would you have 20-30 minutes for a quick call? I'd genuinely value your perspective — and happy to return the favor anytime.
>
> No worries if not — I know you're busy!
>
> Warmly,
> Melissa

### 2. Validation Interview Guide

**Before the Interview:**
- Review their business briefly (website, LinkedIn)
- Have your pitch ready to share when asked
- Prepare to LISTEN more than talk (80/20 rule)

**Opening (2 min):**
> "Thank you so much for taking the time. I'm exploring a new direction and really value your perspective. I'll share a bit about what I'm thinking and then I'd love to hear your honest reactions — including what doesn't land. Sound good?"

**Your Pitch (2 min):**
> "I'm building a strategic partnership service for established entrepreneurs. Here's the idea: I help you separate what's actually moving your business forward from everything else competing for your attention. Then I either handle the other stuff, systematize it, or get it off your plate — so you can execute on what matters without everything else falling through the cracks. I'm not just a coach who asks questions and leaves you to execute. I'm not a VA waiting for task lists. I'm a partner who thinks with you AND stays in the work with you."

**Core Questions:**

**Understanding Their World:**
1. "What does a typical week look like for you right now — where does your time actually go?"
2. "What's the stuff you wish you could get off your plate but hasn't happened yet?"
3. "When you think about growing your business, what's the biggest thing getting in the way?"

**Testing the Offer:**
4. "When you hear what I described, what comes up for you? What's your gut reaction?"
5. "Does this feel like something you'd want? What would need to be true for it to be a 'hell yes'?"
6. "What would make you hesitate?"

**Language Discovery:**
7. "How would you describe the feeling when you're stuck doing stuff that's not really your thing?"
8. "What would it feel like to have that handled — what's the relief you're looking for?"

**Pricing Discovery:**
9. "If something like this existed and it was the right fit, what would feel like a reasonable investment — monthly or per project?"
10. "What would feel too cheap (and make you suspicious)? What would feel too expensive?"

**Ideal Client Discovery:**
11. "Who else do you know that might struggle with this same thing?"
12. "What kind of entrepreneur do you think would be the BEST fit for something like this?"

**Closing:**
> "This has been incredibly helpful. Is there anything else you'd want me to know? And is it okay if I follow up down the road as this takes shape?"

### 4. Handling "No" or Hesitation

**If someone declines the interview:**
> "Totally understand — thanks for letting me know! If you ever want to connect down the road, I'd love that."

(That's it. Move on. It's not about you.)

**If someone seems hesitant in the interview:**
> "I appreciate your honesty — that's exactly what I need to hear. Can you tell me more about what's giving you pause?"

(Their hesitation is data. Lean into it.)

**If someone says "this isn't for me":**
> "That's really helpful to know. Can I ask — who DO you think this would be perfect for?"

(They might give you a referral or help you refine your ICP.)

---

## Finding More Contacts

If you need more than your 3-5 warm contacts:

### Option 1: LinkedIn Search
- Search for "entrepreneur," "founder," "business owner" in your network
- Filter by 1st connections
- Look for people who've been in business 2+ years

### Option 2: Ask for Referrals
- At the end of each interview: "Who else should I talk to?"
- In your outreach: "If you're too busy, is there someone you'd recommend?"

### Option 3: Local Business Groups
- Chamber of Commerce events
- Entrepreneur meetups
- Women in business groups
- Industry associations

### Option 4: Online Communities
- Facebook groups for entrepreneurs
- Slack communities in your industry
- LinkedIn groups

**Target:** 8-10 total conversations over 4 weeks

---

## Mindset Reminders

### On Outreach
- You're not selling. You're learning.
- People love to give advice and feel helpful.
- The worst they can say is no (or nothing). That's fine.
- Every "no" gets you closer to the right people.

### On Pricing
- You're discovering, not deciding yet.
- Reactions tell you more than answers.
- Premium positioning attracts premium clients.
- Underpricing attracts the wrong clients AND burns you out.

### On Imposter Syndrome
- You have 20 years of experience. That's real.
- You're positioning as a partner, not claiming to be perfect.
- Every successful business owner felt this at the start.
- Action cures fear. Keep moving.
