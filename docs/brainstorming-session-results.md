## Session Insights

### The Core Positioning (Refined Through Session)

**Final Pitch:**
> *"I help established entrepreneurs separate what's actually moving their business forward from everything else competing for their attention. Then I either do the other stuff, systematize it, or get it off your plate entirely — so you can execute on what matters without the rest falling through the cracks. I'm not just a coach — I ask the questions AND stay in the work with you. I'm a strategic partner with 20 years of executive experience who sees the whole picture and works alongside you to make sure the right things get done."*

**One-Line Differentiator:**
> *"I don't just help you get clear — I stay in it with you and make sure it actually gets done."*

**Target Emotional Response:**
> "Oh shit, she *gets* me — I need this."
