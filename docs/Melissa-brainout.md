**The Work Itself**

1. Imagine you're in the middle of a great week with a client—what are you actually doing for them?

Okay great meet with a client what yeah what was this question again that there's a couple of meetings maybe with them where we're doing that sort of I don't know what to call it a little bit of brainstorming a little bit of like like maybe what we're doing here is like getting their ideas and like asking questions and you know getting them excited about whatever project they're working on I'm excited about it and helping them find some clarity around it and then being able to go and produce something for them whether it's like I see it a bit as like a Consulting type of thing getting their ideas out helping to create energy around them and then deliver some kind of structure for to be moving through process yes I feel like I'm I'm good at getting the the energy and the excitement about and you know asking the right kinds of questions to get through the shoulds right cuz that's what we all have and then to like put together maybe priorities for them based on what the conversation is and you know suggestions of what we're working on so if it is something specific like a project like if there's someone who wants to be a speaker more and like you know learning more about that getting the structure of it and you know I can say like this is what I can do and like create a plan for like contacting people I think the thing that energizes me the most makes me feel most excited like this week is when I'm with people and talking to people that's going to be the most ideal week for me is that I'm having these conversations 

2. What kinds of messes or chaos do you expect people to have when they come to you? What have you seen in your past work?

That they're trying to do everything and that they feel like they should do everything and that they're overwhelmed by that and really don't know where to where like they've got something that they're passionate about that they love but then they fuck these other things that they have to do like invoicing right but that's that has been like throughout my career when I've when I think back about like the way that I've worked with people in my roles I've been able to help take things off of their plate in a way that is so that they can do the things that they're good at that they love and you know sort of shift Focus away from the what can end up being the productive procrastination so that's the mess of like everything and that overwhelm of the everything and me being able to I kind of cut through the shit and get to act cool what they what they ought to be focusing on whether it's like coming to me or creating different systems to make it easier or something like that yeah that's great 

3. What would need to happen for a client to say "this was worth every penny"?

I think that they would feel a it's going to be feeling space which is Maybe maybe a small harder to sell I think that's why how people make purchases anyway or decisions it is that a feeling right so that they are the did they see that they can Thrive more in their zone of Genius right that's the term that's used a lot and and just I think it's a joy to work with me without make it easy you know and I I am going to work with the individual as a person and like who they are and not with my own preconceived notion of you know this so that needs to be done a certain way so I think that they will feel seen they'll feel heard they'll feel empowered they'll feel joyful like they will have an overall sense of like yeah fucking got this in a way that is is continuing to propel their work forward 

**Who You Serve**

4. Think about people you've worked with before—in jobs, side projects, favors for friends—who was easiest and most satisfying to help?

So I found interestingly I like to working with older businessman I have found in like my Rosary days when you know working with business professionals who were volunteering their time right I knew the value of their time understood that they were you know they had their jobs and then what they were doing was all of this extra time money energy and just sort of like knowing the value of what they were giving and offering and being able to take things off their plate right I think I used the the term before because I don't know what else to call it like managing up right and I had another person who I work for you own a company still owns a company and I was working on specific project but we would have these conversations and he felt like he had to do everything and it was in a way that it felt like I don't know look like coaching but that I could have a really almost conversation with him and like why are you doing this can someone else do this and like help with that and again he's like senior level right the easiest thing was satisfying I'm trying to think of some other examples because I found like some of bumped into some challenges you know and so I'm trying to think of hopefully that's a nice question I don't know if we'll get to that but I would say like where I have found a lot of excitements as well as working with people who are really passionate about what they're doing too and feel like I can be in that energy with them and that's exciting to me and that's exciting to them and you know it makes it a lot easier I think in that way if there's someone who's like oh this thing I was like yes yes the thing that we're working on so that that I think I get very energized but yeah I felt 

5. Who do you already know you don't want to work with, and why?

Financial advisors because they're boring unless they're solo entrepreneurs and have that heart wet passion people who are very new in their entrepreneur Journey or they're like solo business Journey there's a level of overwhelmed that I think comes with that that you know I can even speak for myself like I'm so new I want to do everything I don't quite have things really solidified and like this is the system that I use this is the way that I communicate this you know these sorts of things and you're a little spaghetti at a wall type of thing so I don't want the new new because there's they're not as established in what they're doing they're still drawing from what other people have told them to do and seeing what works if that makes sense yeah I mean they're an exploration mode around what the building and it's just like how can you you're not helping them explore you're helping them refine and get the things that they know that they should be doing right and if they're more decisive then that would make a difference if they're like oh no it's this this but if they're they're not as decisive in those things I found that it's a bit more challenging 

6. When you picture your ideal client, what's their situation? What's going on in their business or life that makes them need you?

So they are someone who's been in business and earning an income of sorts that they have clients that they have money coming in okay whether it's like Prof idea or not okay but there is something coming in and that they've got some solid programs that are well established and they want to do more if they want to create more they want to they they're not just satisfied with that offer this one service and that's that I want to work with people who want to go big or see that they have more to offer and want to take another step or try something else you know if they're doing coaching and they want to add speaking if they're you know doing workshops and Retreats and they want to add a membership if you know that there's there's something that's solid in their business but that they're wanting growth they're wanting more and know that there's sort of on the precipice of like do I hire someone what do I Outsource and knowing that it's like so personal and it's their creation that like I can hold that with them cuz it's hard to just did that it's just someone else who like maybe doesn't hold the the fire and passion that you do as well so what's going on in their business or life I yeah I think I agree 

**Your Edge**

7. What would you do that someone couldn't easily get from a VA service or general contractor?

The understanding of the big picture to really see the vision and understand the vision and how the person fits in their vision and like understand their strengths as well and notice where and like point out where they can maybe shift some things I don't know what to call all of that but I think that sort of bigger vision and many how the little things fit in that so how you feel as always been a skill of mine throughout my career is like I can have this appear big vision and and where the work fits within that for that person no yeah 

8. What do you naturally notice or catch that other people tend to miss?

**I don't know if they miss it but I notice if there's an area that is not a passion of theirs okay if I use you as an example just the way that you spoke about talking about going over like the invoicing things I know it's just you didn't even want to talk about it because it was this headache and like it's it's not what you wanted to look like and it's just like what to do with it so you know that was easy for me to see and be like oh well then we need to shift us away from you we need to change or we need to move it so that it's like you don't need that headache you don't need to like have it taking up space so I think identifying that in a way you know either through conversation or just noticing is is I don't know** 

**Current Reality (Pre-Launch)**

9. What experience are you drawing from—where have you done this kind of work before, even if it wasn't called a business?  
   I mean this has been my entire career 20 years probably more so in my different roles in the world admin area as it's changed working you know as an admin assistant for Consultants as an office manager I have got all of these many years that Drool on not I've always struggled to say admin because it has a very I feel like it's going to very narrow Focus unless you are someone who's got a lot of experience working with people who are skilled in that area really understanding the breadth of the work and I've got that like I've got so much experience and working with you know like those members of the Rotary Club most of them were senior level Executives and so there's that higher level of this this is expectations the standards that come with it right so I've got years of experience working with that sort of sea level individual and being able to sort of meet them where they are and adapt like I've worked in so many different Industries it's never just been one industry so any different kinds of sea level people some quirky and and so I don't know if I got this whole career of of it Beyond just like the freelance work that I did in this capacity and above years ago   
10. What do you already have to work with—skills, tools, connections, time—and what feels like it's missing?

Maybe think about the one that you know that you do have first time I do I do in this area I have I have the skills I feel very confident in it you get to help me say it at the level that I want to say it because I do feel really fucking confident that I can do this I know that I can and I need to be able to say it in a way that people see oh I need this thing Melissa can do it so the skills it's I think I'll need help with I've got them but it'll need help sort of identifying how to package it in a way right and I do need to read a sales book because I don't know how soon do that tools like software right you know I've got things like notion that I've used and I think at all of my jobs it was always in new technology right so no one's ever like notion isn't the one thing Asana isn't the one thing it's always something but I think I know enough to like provide some suggestions of tools or you know you can do the research for that as well the connections is so so I think that's where like my confidence gets in the way of like the connection piece because I'm not always good at staying in contact with people for a very long time I getting embarrassed of like my career failings and then I'm like well you know and so I'm like I don't want to so that one isn't isn't very strong because of my own Hang-Ups that it's sort of come up with that so what's missing connections and I would say the the structure like what we're doing what we're doing here right to to be able to put it all together 

11. What's been stopping you from launching this sooner?

I only recently had the idea like that phone call with you made my fucking day because it was like only a week before that I was like maybe I can relaunch this business in some capacity completely unexpected that you would be like oh well that's interesting and so it's very new I would say I've been if I say like sooner than that okay like what I've been doing the last year and a half I was resistant to it because I felt like it was this smaller and not to sound like I'm disparaging it but where I am it's not a VA roll okay there is more to what I offer so I've been resistant to doing that and so when I've done exercises of like finding my purpose in life and that sort of thing I've kind of discarded my 20 years of experience and like where a can feel excited about this kind of work because I'm like I don't want to just be doing admin right and I do quite find the intersection of it so so that's a big question is why I didn't happen sooner but yeah I'd say that the energy around it is new 

**Future Direction (Building Phase)**

12. A year from now, if this is going well, what does your typical week look like?

That I have several client meetings that I maybe I want to say speaking I I would like to speak okay but yes that does something I would like to do I don't know how it fits with this I can't The Joy thing very separate from this right and I don't think it necessarily needs to I think I'm going to find where it does kind of come together a bit but I would I would like to have several clients who I'm working with and be building something bigger the building something that you know is that there are more services and resources and yeah that I do have more connections and I'm making more connections and I'm I'm building more things so in a way that like you are helping to provide people with the connection from there their own activity to their being in their kind of Joyful Zone and that you are through that work able to see yourself succeed in a way so that you can share out what this is and where the speaking way yes I would love everyone to go real fucking hard on their joy and not just like the Whimsical shit that we do day today I'm all about that okay love that absolutely but to you know it's it's more obvious when it's people who are like the creatives in the office and one to really pushing themselves to like really show themselves through that and I this is why I called it big Joy Company is because I want I would love for people to really tap into what their big Joy is like what is it that is fully theirs that they once they put out into the world right and I would love to build resources and Community around that and I love to inspire people around that so this is where my admin work in this business we're talking about I do see that that can connect right because of the passion that I have and that I see in other people it can get there yeah that there's enough material or stories to share through this work Inspire others yes right so that okay 

13. What kind of work do you absolutely not want to end up doing, even if people would pay you for it?

Hi this is hard because I this is something I have to think about a bit and I get into this headspace where I'm like I want to be of service I want to help people and it's sometimes is in this way that I'm like well I'll do whatever you know and so I'll use website building as an example or maybe something that I do not need to do right I can do it in very basic sort of capacity I don't know the codes but I can find them if I need it to do something a certain way okay so most people just need a brochure side like I can build that but it's not something that I'm highly skilled at and I think that I need to stop offering that is something that I do because it is a little bit of a heavier lift for me and so there are things like that that I feel like I can't get by doing it but it's and I feel like an offer it because I'm like I yeah I can do this better than that perhaps right so they're trying to build a sites on Squarespace or wigs I can do it best thing I'm not better quicker right because I have a bit more experience so I I have to maybe become a bit more Discerning and confidence in saying this is something that I won't do right and I just starting to think of that because it doesn't feel good when I'm like when I can't meet the expectation in that way you know and I a social and I've run into that before where I'm like oh I can do this and then I can't and then it doesn't feel good and then I feel like shit like yeah so I need to get some clothes I know that's the question here but I need to do a bit of work on like some specifics of that I also don't strictly want to be like someone's EA right unless it is a kind of partnership that's more of like a what I imagine like a chief of stuff type of person might be where they're working very closely on like the bigger picture and then able to you know make sure the other work is done so I don't just want to do like VA things but when I'm working in partnership with someone and I can see that there's something that I can do easily invoicing for example happy to like it doesn't feel like it's just a go do this Costco here Melissa and that's all I'm doing I feel like I'm part I feel like I'm a part of this and I'm excited for like what you're going to get to do now and like support you in that way yeah as you were sharing that I found myself away that is what I need like for sure Partnerships 

14. How do you want clients to feel when they describe working with you to a friend?

I want them to feel excited and energized and also want them to feel a sense of relief that they have have someone in there Corner who is going to not create more work but like alleviates some of the tension around all of the work that they have to do but that they feel excited I think that you know having someone who especially if you're working by yourself it's really hard to stay connected to that excitement and so if you have someone who is energized around what you're doing and can help you stay connected to that stay together to that it's happened to their Joy they say they feel connected to the possibilities as well and see that the possibilities of what they want to build can actually come into fruition right like what is what is how do you capture that feeling it's yeah like if it like I said like the possibility they see that that is there's a way forward with it and it doesn't have to just stay here in their head is like a dream 

**The Deeper Layer**

15. What do you already know about what this business should be that you haven't said out loud yet?

**I I want to be talking Co to CEO I I want to position myself as a business owner as an expert in this area that feels different that like I'm embodying that in a way that really puts this in a different space very quickly from a VA service there's there's a service that I'm offering yes but there's an expertise and that I'm that I'm bringing in a confidence as I'm stumbling over my words in in that like I I really want to be able to capture that essence because I can I can be here and talk to you and hear what you have to say and reflect back and ask questions and be in it with you at that level but I don't know that but that's what I want I I also do feel like I I need to do a bit of probably like informational interviews like the market research type of thing I'm not good at that I don't know how but people to maybe reach out to to have a conversation with to understand a bit more so that's maybe I need to understand what the need is I have an idea what what people might like and resonate with but that's something as well that I need to maybe have a few more of those conversations with people who I may want to work with and and get more information so that I I know I'm on the right track**
